## Code Style

odsearcher has a strict code style. It is based on PEP 8, but with a few extra rules:

- Indentation is always tabs. No spaces. No exceptions. Ever.
- There should be a blank line between every function, and two blank lines between every class.
- There should be a blank line between every import (not `__import__`) and the code that follows it.
- Use. Markdownlint. If your markdown isn't compliant with the rules (except no-duplicate-header), I will not accept your PR until you fix it. (Quite frankly, it's not that hard to follow the rules.)

## Pull Requests

When making a pull request, please make sure to follow these guidelines:
